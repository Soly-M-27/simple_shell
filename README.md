# 0x16.C - Simple Shell


## Description


This program runs a simple shell. This shell will
execute the most basic commands present in the bash
shell, while also having access to two built in commands:
exit and env.

## Returns


When successfully compiled, the users prompt will be sent
to search the matching command line that is meant to be
executed and if said command has no matches, an error will
be sent to indicate failure of retrieval.

## Compilation


All files will be compiled with the following:
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c main.h -o shell
